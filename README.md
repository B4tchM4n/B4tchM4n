ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @B4tchM4n!
I work in IT since more than 20 years now.
I work today as IT Project Manager in a french IT Services Company.

My nickname was given to me by my friends when I was student becauce I created lots of semi-graphical applcations in Batch.

Iâ€™m interested in scripting and development of small apps.
I'm also interrested a little in 3D drawing (SketchUp, Blender).
I learned by myself Batch, VBscript and Powershell.
Iâ€™m currently learning C#/.Net on my free time.
